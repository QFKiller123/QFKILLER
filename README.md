# FM-Macro

Just cuz i dislike you Domino :)

My 1st ever mc mod so it's probably not done in "best" way, but who cares. It works, most of the time... :D

https://discord.gg/9TRJKJ4nck if u have questions

```
/fm toggle - turn on/off (autoopen autobuy at once)
/fm bed <x> - bed click speed
/fm debug - displays some debug messages (turn on on 1st use to know what is going on)

Settings aren't saved so u need to set bed speed on each launch
If something bugs out do /fm toggle twice to reset the macro
```
